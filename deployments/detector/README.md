This is the code for the Python Flask API inference container.

- `Dockerfile` contains the commands needed to build the Docker container.
- `app` contains all the code which runs inside the container, including `app.py` which handles all the API stuff (web requests), and `detect.py` which handles all the machine learning stuff.
